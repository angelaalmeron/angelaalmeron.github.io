summary: "Developed a Javascript video game project that replicates the Retro Space Invader."
---


"Retro Space Invader Replica" is exactly as the title entails, it is a replication of the "Retro Space Invader." The game's main objective is for players to earn as many points as they can by eliminating incoming opponents. The player controls the spaceship located at the bottom of the screen that can be rotated up to 180 degrees and shoot projectiles. Opponents appear at the top and descend at a random speed towards the player, each hit on an opponent adds points to the player's score, while missed shots and enemy contacts with the player will reduce the points. 

This project is written in Javascript. Since this is developed under Code.org, an educational platform that provides coding lessons and activities that is typically designed for younger students and educators, the project contains code-blocks or built-in functions and methods like "playSound(url, loop)" or ".isTouching(target)" as an instance. Additionally, I have mostly utilized the "Sprite" functions for the project's game elements, and for those who may not be familiar what "sprite" is, it is "a two-dimensional (2D) graphical object used in computer graphics, particularly in video games" (Andrew LÃ¶w, [What is a sprite?](https://www.codeandweb.com/knowledgebase/what-is-a-sprite#:~:text=A%20sprite%20is%20a%20two,combined%20to%20create%20an%20animation.)). 

If you are ever interested, you can try out the video game yourself! (https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/sAhIqEup5uvzhhMh6Y3HpP83U-ac6m9WPs0KxE6B8w8)
