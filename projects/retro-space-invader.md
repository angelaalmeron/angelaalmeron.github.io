summary: "Developed a Javascript video game project that replicates the Retro Space Invader."
---
This was the very first programming project I have developed myself for an assignment in my junior year of high school. It is a replication of the game "Retro Space Invader," where the main goal of the game is to gain as much points as you can by eliminating the incoming opponents but will lose points or the game itself if you were hit by the opponents.



If you are ever interested, you can try out the video game yourself! (https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/sAhIqEup5uvzhhMh6Y3HpP83U-ac6m9WPs0KxE6B8w8)
