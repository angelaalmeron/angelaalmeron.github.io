summary: "Developed a Javascript video game project that replicates the Retro Space Invader."
---


**Retro Space Invader Replica** is exactly as the title entails, it is a replication of the "Retro Space Invader." 

This project is written in Javascript and since this is developed under **Code.org**, an educational platform that provides coding lessons and activities that is typically designed for younger students and educators, it contains code-blocks or built-in functions and methods like **playSound(url, loop)** or **.isTouching(target)** as an instance. Additionally, I have mostly utilized the **Sprite** functions for the project's game elements, and for those who may not be familiar what "sprite" is, it is *"a two-dimensional (2D) graphical object used in computer graphics, particularly in video games"* (Andrew LÃ¶w, [What is a sprite?](https://www.codeandweb.com/knowledgebase/what-is-a-sprite#:~:text=A%20sprite%20is%20a%20two,combined%20to%20create%20an%20animation.)). 

At the time of the project, it is a full hands-on experience or application to what I have learned about the basic syntax of programming and the programming language, Javascript. This learning experience includes declaring or initializing variables, creating functions, if-statements, and debugging. 

**Fun Fact:** This is the very first programming project I have ever developed myself! Though it is a mere assignment in my junior year of highschool, it is one of the first projects that I felt proud of and what drove me to gain more and more interest in choosing computer science as a major or career. Other than enjoying in creating this project, it was also a first fun challenge in terms of debugging and finding the issue to the program itself.

If you are ever interested, you can try out the video game yourself with an option to view the code as well! [Retro Space Invader](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/sAhIqEup5uvzhhMh6Y3HpP83U-ac6m9WPs0KxE6B8w8)
