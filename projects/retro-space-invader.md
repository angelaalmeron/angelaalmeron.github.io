**Retro Space Invader Replica** is exactly as the title entails, I developed a project that is a replication of the "Retro Space Invader." In brief details, the game's main objective is for players to earn as many points as they can by eliminating incoming opponents. The player controls the spaceship located at the bottom of the screen that can be rotated up to 180 degrees and shoot projectiles. Opponents appear at the top and descend at a random speed towards the player, each hit on an opponent adds points to the player's score, while missed shots and enemy contacts with the player will reduce the points. 

This project is written in Javascript and since this is developed under **Code.org**, an educational platform that provides coding lessons and activities that is typically designed for younger students and educators, it contains code-blocks or built-in functions and methods like **playSound(url, loop)** or **.isTouching(target)** as an instance. For this project specifically, I have mostly utilized the **Sprite** functions for the project's game elements, and for those who may not be familiar what "sprite" is, it is *"a two-dimensional (2D) graphical object used in computer graphics, particularly in video games"* (Andrew LÃ¶w, [What is a sprite?](https://www.codeandweb.com/knowledgebase/what-is-a-sprite#:~:text=A%20sprite%20is%20a%20two,combined%20to%20create%20an%20animation.)). 

At the time of the project, it is a full hands-on experience or application to what I have learned about the basic syntax of programming and the programming language, Javascript. This learning experience includes declaring or initializing variables, creating functions, if-statements, and debugging. 

**Fun Fact:** This is the very first programming project I have ever developed myself! Though it is a mere assignment in my junior year of highschool, it is one of the first projects that I felt proud of and what drove me to gain more and more interest in choosing computer science as a major or career. Other than enjoying in creating this project, it was also a fun challenge when debugging and finding the issue to the program itself.

If you are ever interested, you can try out the video game yourself with an option to view the code as well! [Retro Space Invader](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/sAhIqEup5uvzhhMh6Y3HpP83U-ac6m9WPs0KxE6B8w8)
