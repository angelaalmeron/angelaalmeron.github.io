summary: "Developed a Javascript app project that will help users learn the Lahainaluna High School's alma mater song."
---
**LHS Alma Mater** is an interactive application I developed to help users, particularly the students of Lahainaluna High School, learn the school's alma mater song. The main user-friendly features of this app is users can click on any line of the song and it will play the Class of 2021 students singing that line specifically. One additional feature I would like to highlight is that since the song is in ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi, I added an English translation right below of that specific line of the song to fully carry out the purpose of this app.

This app is written in Javascript, and similarly to ["Retro Space Invader Replica"](https://angelaalmeron.github.io/projects/retro-space-invader.html), this is also hosted under **Code.org**, an educational platform that provides coding lessons and activities that is typically designed for younger students and educators, where it contains code-blocks or built-in functions and methods like playSound(url, loop) or .isTouching(target) as an instance. 

For this project, it is a continuation of applying to what I have learned in terms of the basic syntax of programming and the programming language, JavaScript. However, the only difference from this project is I shifted to writing or typing the code myself without the help of code-blocks or utilizing it. This shift created a slightly new challenge for me because at the time, I was feeling frustrated to keep track the blocks of code, or in other words, keeping track of the parentheses, brackets, and semi-colons. Nevertheless, I still find it significantly helpful because it allowed me to apply my understanding more deeply.

If you are interested, you can try out the app yourself with an option to view the code as well! [LHS Alma Mater App](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/vA4huXufMyU3RNVgLMtgHObxCiyUk9p19UHcsBO6hLQ)
