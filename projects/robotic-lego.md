summary: "My team and I from the ICS department worked together on a robotic lego project for middle school students visiting UH Manoā, to engage and learn computer science."

**Dyector Robot** utilizes the [LEGO Education SPIKE Prime](https://spike.legoeducation.com/prime/lobby/), an innovative robotics kit, to educate middle school students, who were visiting UH Manoā, the essential STEM concepts through hands-on learning experience, particularly about computer software and hardware. My team and I planned this project out in a way that students can enjoy engaging with, but also educate them a few of the important aspects of computer science. This includes the definition of software and hardware, the agile methodology, conditional if-else statements, and most importantly, working together as a team. We don't mean working with their own teams, but with the other teams as well. To be specific with this instance, the software and hardware team will need to work together by continuously communicating to each other in order to enhance the product's quality. 

In this project, I was more responsible in programming, testing, and enhancing the code for how the robot should operate. This is to ensure that there were no bugs, connection, or operation issues with the robot, so that when the students try it out for themselves would be a breeze. Furthermore, I was also responsible in structuring the code that students can engage with in their level. In further details for the structure that I would like to highlight, I left the robot's movements and one conditional statement filled with actions when the robot detected a specific color, while the rest of the conditional statements has empty actions when detecting other colors. This way the students can be creative and enjoy engaging with programming. 

Overall, this project was more wholesome for me, interacting with kids and helping them learn computer science. However, it was also a great learning experience for me in terms of educating and guiding students properly without directly giving them the solution but rather, helping them be creative in their own way. Since this was the first project I have been a part of in the ICS department, an addition from this project to me is how to become a great major advisor and guide students through their academic journey and success!

**A fun fact about the name: Dye + Detector = Dyector**. This is because the robot's sole purpose is to perform a specific action when detecting a color.
