summary: "My team and I from the ICS department worked together on a robotic lego project for middle school students visiting UH Manoā, to engage and learn computer science."

**LEGO SPIKE Robot** is an innovative robotics kit that is designed to educate middle and high school students the essential STEM concepts through hands-on learning experience. In this particular case, it was middle school students who were visiting UH Manoā. Therefore, my team and I decided to help educate the students a few of the important and simple aspects of computer science, such as the definition, agile methodology, conditional if-else statements, and most importantly, working together as a team. 

For this project, I worked with my team in deciding and building the LEGO robot, but I was more responsible in programming, testing, and enhancing the code or how the robot should operate.
