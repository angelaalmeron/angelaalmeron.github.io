## How can I, as a software engineer, change the world?
I've been thinking that everyday, millions of lines of code are written to solve complex problems with complex algorithms, yet the individuals behind these solutions often remain in the shadows. Now, does it ever matter to me? To be visible behind the works? No, it does not. Why? simple--ever since I've been introduced to computer science, programming, software engineering, and somewhere along those lines, I made one life? dream? goal for myself and that is to develop, program, and design works that can impact or in best-case scenario, change the world. Take ChatGPT as an example, many students, tech professionals I've talk to in career fairs, or even professors in my university publicly admitted in class of using it. Though I am fully aware of this AI tool being abused of certain things, I still see it as an impact to many people because almost majority of people would use it as a form of help to understand, brainstorm, receive information quickly rather than scrolling through Google searches, to enhance writing, and several other things. This is all I would care as a software engineer, simply knowing the fact that I've created something that impacted and helped many people.
