## A TypeScript Newbie
### First Impressions & Thoughts
Coming from someone who have no prior knowledge of TypeScript, I've found this experience of learning and writing in TypeScript quite fun and interesting. It has been quite some time since I last worked with JavaScript—-since my junior year of high school, to be precise—-so my skills were understandably a bit rusty. Luckily, my ICS 314 class provided a great opportunity for me to brush up on JavaScript with over 100+ modules on FreeCodeCamp, which set a solid foundation for my TypeScript learning. How does this set the foundation for Typescript? This is because of the striking similarities in syntax that TypeScript and JavaScript share. Therefore, the tutorials for Typescript were a bit easy to understand. Even so, TypeScript has its own unique features and enhancements, particularly useful for managing larger code bases, an area where JavaScript is typically less efficient. 

Despite this learning progress, I frequently find myself more naturally inclined to write in JavaScript or other programming languages I am more used to--like Java as an instance--when tackling TypeScript exercises or asked to write in TypeScript. In that case, moving forward, I will continuously immerse myself more in TypeScript through practices, to fully grasp all its capabilities and become accustomed to like the other programming languages.

### From a Software Engineer Standpoint
To think about it, is this language beneficial for software engineers? Absolutely! TypeScript provides significant advantages, as I've previously mentioned, it is quite useful particularly for managing large, complex projects where the benefits of type safety and enhanced tooling lead to better maintainability and fewer bugs. Not only that, it's more efficient, great clarity, and more concised to work with!

### A ES6 Newbie Too!
Though this technical essay focuses entirely on training myself with TypeScript, I don't want to be negligent with this ES6-—also known as ECMAScript 2015—-a major update to JavaScript in 2015, that I haven't heard of before, even in my CS studies. Since it was part of the JavaScript tutorials in my ICS 314 class, learning about was quite interesting and englightening as well. Similarly to TypeScript, ES6 has brought enhancements that have made JavaScript not only more efficient and easier to manage but also helped developers to write cleaner, more error-free code. A highlight to some of my favorite additions include arrow functions, promises, and classes, each feeling like a new, handy tool in my programming kit. 

## Athletic Training: Software Engineering Version
### What is Athletic Software Engineering?
For in-depth details, read the essay ["Athletic Software Engineering (2017)"](https://philipmjohnson.org/essays/ase-2017.html) written by Professor Philip Johnson. To briefly summarize the key points of the essay, think of it as athletic training in sports, where athletes are trained regularly to improve their physical skills and tactical understanding. "Athletic Software Engineering" is just the same, but in software engineering. It emphasizes regular, rigorous practice of coding skills under a variety of conditions to enhance both efficiency and problem-solving abilities in software development. This approach is about pushing the boundaries of what one can handle technically, much like an athlete pushes their physical limits.

### First Impressions & Thoughts about WODs
To achieve this pedagogy, ICS 314 introduced WODs (Workout of the Day) as our coding training. The very first graded WOD we had in class was quite stressful and nerve-wracking for me because we are all being pressured by time. Surprisingly, I love it because it pumps me up and actually challenge me. Perhaps, over time or at the end of the semester, I may begin to become accustomed to it, and continue to create strategies to improve my performance. 

How is this helpful? It mimicks real-world scenarios! With these practices, it enforces us to write code that should be clear and efficient under pressure.
