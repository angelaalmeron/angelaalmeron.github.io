## Perfectionism Character
If you were to get to know me more personally, you'd gradually see how much of a perfectionist I can be. Most people, including myself (occasionally), may consider this trait as a "bad thing." I set very high expectations for myself that I often stress about, struggle to let go of even the smallest mistakes (and I mean, it is quite difficult), and have trouble finishing tasks quickly because I use up most of my time to pay great GREAT attention to every little details. In the end, I simply can't help it, especially because noticing small imperfections would bother me for hours or, in the worst case, days. It has simply become an essential part of my daily functioning, or in simple terms, a habit.

### Perfectionism isn't all bad
Do I frequently see it as a "bad thing"? To me, not really, because there are other aspects of this trait that can be considered as an advantage. Those high expectations I create, drives me to work very hard to successfully meet them, or generally, I work to make things "just right" (a nod to *"Goldilocks and the Three Bears"*). Another benefit that came to mind is aiming to be well-organized and systematic in everything I do. I absolutely love to plan ahead because it reassures me that these tasks are reasonably manageable. One easy example is a filled-up calendar, ensuring each and every deadline is met. 

Another example that I am particularly proud of is a system I've created on a platform called *Notion*, described as *"a productivity and note-taking web application"* ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notion_(productivity_software))). I like to call it my "College-Life Dashboard," which centralizes all of the essentials I need for college. It includes details of all my current semester classes like syllabus information, scores, deadlines, and notes. There are two calendars: one for assignment and exam deadlines, and another for work projects and college events I may be interested in attending. My biggest favorite feature is the *quick capture* on the left corner of the page, which has buttons for adding new deadlines or events to the calendar, or for creating structured Cornell-style notes for a class lecture. Other additional features on the corner include *navigation* (directed to all pages like deadlines, notes, etc.), music playlist to listen to while studying, a Pomodoro-"a time management method...it uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique))-timer, and last but not least, helpful resouurces that link directly to their websites.
